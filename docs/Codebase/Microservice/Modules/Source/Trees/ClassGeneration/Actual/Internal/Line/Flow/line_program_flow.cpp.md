# line_program_flow.cpp

- Source document: [line.cpp.md](../line.cpp.md)
- Purpose: decoupled implementation logic for a future code unit.

This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of line_program_flow.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Opening Intent
Quick summary: This slice shows the opening intent of line_program_flow.cpp and the first major actions that frame the rest of the flow.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N1["Reading the input"]
    N2["Enter tokenize_text()"]
    N3["Split text"]
    N4["Record output"]
    N5["Clean text"]
    N6["Assemble tree"]
    N7["Loop collection"]
    N8["More items?"]
    N9["Branch condition"]
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 2 - Early Branches
Quick summary: This slice covers the first branch-heavy continuation of line_program_flow.cpp after the opening path has been established.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N1["Stop path"]
    N2["Return result"]
    N3["Small preparation steps"]
    N4["Enter join_tokens()"]
    N5["Populate outputs"]
    N6["Serialize report"]
    N7["Loop collection"]
    N8["More items?"]
    N9["Branch condition"]
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 3 - Mid-Flow Handoff
Quick summary: This slice captures the mid-flow handoff in line_program_flow.cpp where preparation turns into deeper processing.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N1["Stop path"]
    N2["Return result"]
    N3["Enter split_lines()"]
    N4["Split text"]
    N5["Read lines"]
    N6["More items?"]
    N7["Record output"]
    N8["Assemble tree"]
    N9["Loop collection"]
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 4 - Secondary Decision Path
Quick summary: This slice focuses on the next decision path in line_program_flow.cpp and the outcomes that follow from it.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N0["More items?"]
    N1["Branch condition"]
    N2["Continue?"]
    N3["Stop path"]
    N4["Return result"]
    N5["Supporting steps"]
    N6["Enter file_basename()"]
    N7["Clean text"]
    N8["Branch condition"]
    N9["Continue?"]
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 5 - Follow-Through Stage
Quick summary: This slice follows the next working stage of line_program_flow.cpp after the earlier decisions have narrowed the path.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N0["Stop path"]
    N1["Return result"]
    N2["Enter include_target_from_line()"]
    N3["Read lines"]
    N4["More items?"]
    N5["Tokenize input"]
    N6["Loop collection"]
    N7["More items?"]
    N8["Branch condition"]
    N9["Continue?"]

    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 6 - Late-Stage Checks
Quick summary: This slice highlights later checks and continuation steps in line_program_flow.cpp before the run approaches its end.
Why this is separate: line_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.
