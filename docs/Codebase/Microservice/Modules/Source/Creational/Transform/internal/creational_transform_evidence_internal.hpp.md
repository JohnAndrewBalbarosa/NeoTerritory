# creational_transform_evidence_internal.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Source/Creational/Transform/internal/creational_transform_evidence_internal.hpp
- Kind: C++ header
- Lines: 96
- Role: Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers.
- Chronology: Runs after the generic parse tree exists so creational detection or transformation can operate on it.

## Notable Symbols
- SingletonCallsiteEvidence
- EvidenceScanResult
- MonolithicClassView
- collect_class_signature_lines
- collect_method_signature_lines
- brace_delta
- retain_single_main_function
- scan_pattern_evidence
- ensure_class_view

- sstream
- string
- vector

## File Outline
### Responsibility

This source file implements a creational transform or evidence-rendering stage. It runs after the generic parse tree has been built and focuses on turning detected structure into rewritten code or explanatory evidence views. This source file implements creational-pattern analysis over the generic parse tree. It inspects parsed structure, applies pattern-specific rules, and emits detector results that later appear in the creational tree or transform decisions.

### Position In The Flow

Runs after the generic parse tree exists so creational detection or transformation can operate on it.

### Main Surface Area

Implements creational transform dispatch, evidence rendering, and rewrite helpers. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as SingletonCallsiteEvidence, EvidenceScanResult, MonolithicClassView, and collect_class_signature_lines. It collaborates directly with Transform/creational_code_generator_internal.hpp, sstream, string, and vector.
