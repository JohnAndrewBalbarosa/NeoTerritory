# hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp

- Source document: [hash_links_collect.cpp.md](../hash_links_collect.cpp.md)
- Purpose: decoupled implementation logic for a future code unit.

This diagram follows the action path in plain words. Decision diamonds show where the file can stop, branch, or repeat work instead of simply passing through a straight line.

The flow is intentionally split into smaller slices so the major intent of hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp stays readable. Each slice names the stage it is covering, gives a quick summary, and explains why that stage is separated from the next one.


### Program Flow Slices
#### Slice 1 - Opening Intent
Quick summary: This slice shows the opening intent of hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp and the first major actions that frame the rest of the flow.
Why this is separate: hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N2["Enter collect_side_nodes()"]
    N3["Collect facts"]
    N4["Record output"]
    N5["Populate outputs"]
    N6["Assemble tree"]
    N7["Compute hashes"]
    N8["Loop collection"]
    N9["More items?"]
    N0 --> N1
    N1 --> N2
    N2 --> N3
    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 2 - Early Branches
Quick summary: This slice covers the first branch-heavy continuation of hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp after the opening path has been established.
Why this is separate: hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N8["Branch condition"]

    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 3 - Mid-Flow Handoff
Quick summary: This slice captures the mid-flow handoff in hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp where preparation turns into deeper processing.
Why this is separate: hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N6["Look up entries"]
    N7["Compute hashes"]
    N8["Branch condition"]
    N9["Continue?"]

    N1 --> N2

    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 4 - Secondary Decision Path
Quick summary: This slice focuses on the next decision path in hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp and the outcomes that follow from it.
Why this is separate: hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.

    N5["Record output"]
    N6["Populate outputs"]
    N7["Compute hashes"]
    N8["Loop collection"]
    N9["More items?"]

    N3 --> N4
    N4 --> N5
    N5 --> N6
    N6 --> N7
    N7 --> N8
    N8 --> N9
```

#### Slice 5 - Follow-Through Stage
Quick summary: This slice follows the next working stage of hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp after the earlier decisions have narrowed the path.
Why this is separate: hash_links_collect_program_flow.cpp has multiple branches, loops, or stage changes, so this section is split out to keep one major intent visible at a time instead of forcing one oversized diagram.
