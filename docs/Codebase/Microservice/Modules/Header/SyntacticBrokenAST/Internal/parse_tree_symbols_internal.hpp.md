# parse_tree_symbols_internal.hpp

- Source: Microservice/Modules/Header/SyntacticBrokenAST/Internal/parse_tree_symbols_internal.hpp
- Kind: C++ header
- Lines: 36
- Role: Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline.
- Chronology: This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

## Notable Symbols
- trim
- starts_with
- split_words
- class_name_from_signature
- function_name_from_signature
- function_parameter_hint_from_signature
- build_function_key
- is_main_function_name

## Direct Dependencies
- parse_tree_symbols.hpp
- string
- vector

## File Outline
### Responsibility

This header implements the compile-time contract for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. It is included before runtime execution begins so the C++ sources can agree on the shared data structures and function signatures.

### Position In The Flow

This artifact participates in the repository flow according to the surrounding module or toolchain that loads it.

### Main Surface Area

Declares the public interfaces and shared data types for the generic parse and analysis pipeline. The main surface area is easiest to track through symbols such as trim, starts_with, split_words, and class_name_from_signature. It collaborates directly with parse_tree_symbols.hpp, string, and vector.
